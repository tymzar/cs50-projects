# cs50-projects

Projects stored in this repository are for the AI course at Harvard University. The projects are written in Python and are based on the course's problem sets.

## Project 0: Degrees

This project is a program that determines how many "degrees of separation" apart two actors are. The program takes in two actors and determines the shortest path between them. The program uses a breadth-first search algorithm to determine the shortest path between the two actors.

## Project 0: Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a program that allows a user to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an AI. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move to make. The AI is unbeatable.

### Optimizations

After implementin the minimax algorithm, I decided to implement some optimizations to the AI. The first improvement I made was to implement alpha-beta pruning. This optimization reduced the number of nodes that the AI had to search through by a significant amount.
